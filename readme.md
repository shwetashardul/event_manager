## Reflcection
- During my "Event Manager" assignment, one significant challenge I encountered was identifying errors in the code, akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. However, each mistake I uncovered was a revelatory moment, illuminating the path forward much like solving a puzzle; once the first piece clicked into place, the subsequent ones followed more naturally.
- In terms of collaborative processes, managing different branches and synchronizing my efforts posed distinct challenges. Maintaining alignment with my progress while handling various features demanded meticulous communication and organization. Leveraging Git for version control and GitHub for issue tracking and code reviews, I realized the benefits of these tools even in individual projects. They functioned like virtual assistants, meticulously recording my tasks and helping me stay organized.
- Reflecting on the assignment, I recognize significant personal and professional growth. Delving into the complexities of REST API functionality and mastering Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration were just the beginning. I also gained practical experience with Docker for containerization and pytest for automated testing, broadening my technical repertoire. Moreover, the process sharpened my problem-solving skills as I navigated through debugging and solution implementation, deepening my understanding of software development practices.
Overall, this assignment was not merely about task completion but about continuous learning and self-improvement. I am proud of the strides I've made and the comprehensive set of skills I've acquired, which have prepared me for future challenges in the tech industry.
